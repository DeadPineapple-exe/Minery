WTo beat game: There are parts of a code that you must put in the right order. 
Let's call the code "5USH1"
Puzzles to solve: 

1. Ancient script 
Get pickaxe lvl 3 (out of 5), bust down a fractured in the shop ( wall uses â€” em dash symbol), buy a box, inside the box is a piece of paper. The piece of paper with encoded text will be stationed in the main base.
    The paper reads:

    1. abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

    2. WKH WKLUG FKDUDFWHU LV V

    Someone's commentary:
    The people here decided that our language was really funny. 
    So we decided to make a new language.
    Let's see... maybe it should use the same alphabet.
    On the third and fourth day, they decided to test this shifting on the answer you seek.
    Oh, and maybe we can translate into the new language
    by moving the letters 3 spaces backwards!
    This will be a very genius solution!
    - said some random ancient people
Decrypting the message should say: "THE THIRD CHARACTER IS S"

2. Dog (also unlocks code room) 
In one of the mine rooms, there is a chest with a piece of paper. This paper tells you how to unlock the mystery in the main base.
  Paper reads:
  To whoever finds this...
  If you knock the door 5 times, my pet dog will answer. Don't worry, he has a superpower where he doesn't die of hunger or dehydration.
  However, his only weakness is that he's been bored for centuries. I've pretty sure his dog toys is somewhere in world (mapX, mapY) decide later 
Mystery door gets a new action to knock. Once you knock on the door 5 times, a pet dog will replace mystery door.
  If you knock 10 times without finding the letter, it gives a clue to where the letter is
If you have the ball, you get new action to give the dog a ball. Pet dog will now leave and reveal new door to the code room. On the door you find an engraving which says "2nd one: U"

3. Quiz / Needy guy
NPC somewhere in the mines. When you interact, you get a chance to help the NPC. He will ask questions and request for random ores / cash, and you must give it to him. Complete the requirements for him to give you something and to say "Good job on completing my quiz! Now, the first part of the code is the number of vowels in the English alphabet" which is 5.

4. Math problem
Located in the corner of the code room. 
Really a trick question, because anything to the power of 0 is 0.
The question: 
  x = 5
  y = [[( x / 1+8 )^5x/2 ]^3 + ( 5 + x/5 )^9 ]^0 
  key: the number that goes in position x is the number y
  
5. In one of the mines level 4, find a chest which starts the scavenger hunt.
Go to the place listed in the chest.
There will be another chest there which gives a new location.
Continuously follow this path 10 times throughout the mines to have the final one say "That must've taken you a while. Slot 4 = H"
